Hey, welcome to this website. I am Yubin Liu, a master student in [Oishi Lab](https://www.cvl.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), EEIS, the University of Tokyo.

During my free time, I love to travel and explore new places, especially museums. As I am currently residing in Japan, I have taken full advantage of this opportunity and have traveled to some of the most breathtaking destinations in the country including Kyoto, Nagoya, Hokkaido, Hamamatsu and Kanazawa. Here is one of my favourite photo taken by my friend at Tenku Torii, Kawaguchi Lake, Yamanashi.
