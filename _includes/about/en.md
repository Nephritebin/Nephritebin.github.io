Hey, welcome to this website. I am Yubin Liu, a master student in [Oishi Lab](https://www.cvl.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), EEIS, the University of Tokyo. I am also selected as the member of [WINGS-CFS program](https://cfs.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/). I got my bachelor degree at Zhejiang University, China. My research topic is about robotics, planning and reinforcement learning. If you want to contact me, please feel free to send email to `yubinliu925@gmail.com` . 

During my free time, I love to travel and explore new places, especially museums. As I am currently residing in Japan, I have taken full advantage of this opportunity and have traveled to some of the most breathtaking destinations in the country including Kyoto, Nagoya, Hokkaido, Hamamatsu and Kanazawa. Here is one of my favorite photo taken by my friend at Tenku Torii, Kawaguchi Lake, Japan.

I'm also a person who likes anime. My favorite animation is land of lustrous, which is also the name of this website. Other series I like include K-ON, Violet Evergarden, 5 Centimeters Per Second and recently Laid-Back Camp. You may find that I am a fun of Kyoto Animation Company, since I use a lot of images from there animations to be the covers of my blogs (◍•ᴗ•◍).
