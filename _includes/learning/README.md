# Oh Yes, I like it

I'm interested to expanding my knowledge and exploring a wide array of subjects that ignite my enthusiasm. My interests range from the arts and linguistics to artificial intelligence, and even include my culinary creations. Currently, I am focused on building a comprehensive personal knowledge base, for which I've chosen Obsidian as my primary note-taking software. 

Although my blog's `archive` page categorizes each post, I prefer to selectively share content that I find truly fascinating or about which I am deeply passionate at here. Some items are as follows:
