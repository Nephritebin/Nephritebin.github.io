# Online Courses

Here are the slides, notes, assignments and references of some high qualified online courses about computer science, math and robotics.
Because my research topic is robotics, this list DO NOT include other advanced topics in computer science except for machine learning and computer vision.

The list is divided into three parts: 
1. Basic computer science courses, which is about the fundamental knowledge, skills and trainings for computer science students. Most of them are undergraduate courses in UCB, MIT, CMU and Stanford. The topics of these courses include programming languages, data structure, algorithms, computer network, computer architecture and operating system. All the course in this part have relatively complete materials and homework, which enable self-learning. Notice that there are many similar courses for one topic, so I just choose the most preferred one for me.
2. Math courses, including undergraduate courses and graduate course for students who are not major in math. The topics of these courses include discrete math, probability, linear algebra and matrix theory, Lie group and lie algebra, group theory, convex optimization and numerical methods. All the courses here are for students in computer science or engineering, so it may be a little easy (really ?) comparing with courses for math students. These are part of the math background for computer science, because I don't want to list the calculus or basic linear algebra, etc.
3. Applications, which are some significant courses of my own research areas. The courses mainly concrete on computer vision, machine learning, reinforcement learning, robotics and control theory.

We also have some courses that have to be finished on Linux system. I listed them in another repository. You can check them in this [link](https://github.com/Nephritebin/Online-Course-using-Linux). Moreover, considering that there are some courses that don't have coding assignments, I listed them in this [repository](https://github.com/Nephritebin/Online-Course-without-Coding), including some courses of MIT Data science micro-master from EDX and other math or theoretic courses. 

If I invade your copyright, or you have any questions, please email [yubinliu@zju.edu.cn](mailto:yubinliu@zju.edu.cn). I would also appreciate it if you point out the errors in my assignments answers. If you have any other courses or materials which you recommend, please don't hesitate to contact me, too.

Here are the courses in this repository:

## 1. Basic Computer Science courses

### 1. [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://cs61a.org/) (Finished)
This is *CS61a: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Fall 2021* from University of California, Berkeley. The course concentrates on the idea of abstraction, but it is also a very fantastic material for freshman of python. All the 14 labs, 11 homework and 4 projects are available on the course website, and what is more thankful is that all the problems can be judged using the ok system provided by UCB. You can also find the videos of the course in Spring 2021 on [this website](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1mq4y1f7te).

### 2. [Data Structures](https://sp21.datastructur.es/) (Project 2 in processing)
This is *CS61b: Data Structures, Spring 2021* from University of California, Berkeley. 
Much of CS 61B will be concerned with the trade-offs in time and memory for a variety of methods for structuring data. This course will also be concerned with the engineering knowledge and skills needed to build and maintain moderately large programs.
In spring 2021, the Gradescope course activation code is P5WVGW, which is published for self-learners. Thanks a million!

### 3. [Introduction to Algorithmic Thinking](https://algorithmicthinking.github.io/#/) (In processing)
This is *CS 198-112 Leetcode 101ï¼šIntroduction to Algorithmic Thinking* from University of California, Berkeley. This course provides some problem lists for freshman to learn algorithms using leetcode. I collect all my answers of problems mentioned in this course on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) in this repository. 

### 4. [Self Pace Program of C++](https://selfpaced.bitbucket.io/#/cpp/calendar)
This is *CS9* series courses in 2019 Spring offered by University of California, Berkeley.  The courses are for programmers who wish to learn a second language, including C, Java, Python, MATLAB, C++ and UNIX. Here I just use the materials of C++, and the course number is CS9F. The assignments and textbooks for this course are available online. I plan to finish the four assignments in a week. By the way, as for second language learning, I recommend CS61a for Python and CS61b for Java, and both of them can be found in this list. 


## 2. Math Courses

### 1. [Convex Optimization](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/convexopt/)

### 2. [Mathematical Methods for Robotics, Vision, and Graphics](http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs205a/index.html)

### 3. [Discrete Differential Geometry](https://brickisland.net/DDGSpring2021/)

### 4. [Optimization Models in Engineering](https://eecs127.github.io/)

### 5. [Probability and Random Processes](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee126/fa22/index.html)

## 3. Application Courses

### 1. Computer Vision I (Finished)
This is [*CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition*](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) from Stanford University. I finished all the course videos in 2017, the assignments 1, 2 and 3 (except Transformer) in 2021 Spring and some additional materials. You can find my notes in English at this [link](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/381357994). The official notes are published on the course website.

I also added the slides and notes of [*IN2364: Advanced Deep Learning for Computer vision, Spring 2020*](https://dvl.in.tum.de/teaching/adl4cv-ss20/) from Technical University of Munich. This course includes some recent topics of learning based computer vision.

### 2. Computer Vision II (Only quizzes, in processing)
This is a combination of two courses: [*16-385: Computer Vision, Spring 2020*](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~16385/) from Carnegie Mellon University and [*CS131: Computer Vision: Foundations and Applications, Fall 2020*](http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs131_fall2021/index.html) from Stanford University. I only have the access to the slides, textbooks, quiz and assignments. I finished all the slides and quiz from 16-385 and all assignments from CS131. Notice that there are some bugs in hw7 2.2 section which I didn't fix.

Actually, this project focus on some basic concepts of computer vision, so I recommend finishing it before Computer Vision I. However, the names of the courses were given based on my study sequence. 

### 3. Computer Vision III (Assignment 3 in processing)
This is also a combination of two courses: [*CS231a: Computer Vision, From 3D Reconstruction to Recognition, Winter 2021*](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs231a/syllabus.html) from Stanford University and [Multiple View Geometry, 2014](https://vision.in.tum.de/teaching/online/mvg) from Technical University of Munich. I plan to finish all the 5 assignments in CS231a and the [lectures](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTBdjV_4f-EJn6udZ34tht9EVIW7lbeo4) in MVG with notes. You can compare the homework results with [this public repository](https://github.com/chizhang529/cs231a), please use it for learning purposes.

This is the final part of basic computer vision courses in my study route. In Computer Vision I, the lectures taught the learning based vision and some recent research topics. In Computer Vision II, the courses taught the basic concepts and the outline of computer vision. In computer vision III, we mostly focus on geometry based vision and motions.
